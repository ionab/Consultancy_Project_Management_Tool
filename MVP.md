Timesheet and Expenses Submission App.

Consultants who sell their time, usually work on a time and expenses financial contract with their clients. Once a project has been commissioned from a client the only way for a consultant to manage their budget is by tracking time and expenses through employee time sheets.

I want to track employee time and expenses in an attempt to keep projects within budget. I have decided to make a budgeting app to help see where project time and money is being spent.

I will be able to create new time transactions which will include a project code, employee id, and time_unit. I will be able to create an expenses transaction which will include a project code, employee id and cost. I will be able to view all the time and expenses allocated to a given project and view if this is within budget.

A project will have a budget, client and expenditure.
 
MVP:
  - Add a project.
  - View a list of projects.
  - Add a time and allocate this to a category(project management, etc.)
  - Add an expense and allocate this to a category(travel, accommodation, etc.)
  - Have a view where I can see if a project is over budget.
  - Add a new employee.
  - See a list of employees.

POTENTIAL EXTENSIONS:
  - Add other CRUD functions for each of your classes.
    - eg. list all time on projects.
  - Calculate TAX from expenses.
  - Add date to project time_units or expenses.
